# Train Domain LLM with GRPO

motivation

-   wanted to try something original and get my hands dirty.

Question

-   can I make a model create a schedule from a list of events and priorities?

would have forced me to think about

-   problem setting, 
-   generate data, 
-   choose the base model, 
-   design reward functions, 
-   run multiple rounds of training, 

hoping that my model would learn something.
