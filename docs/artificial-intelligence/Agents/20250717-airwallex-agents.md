-   Recommended entry points:
    -   **Customer service bots**
    -   **Internal knowledge assistants**
    -   **Marketing content generation**
    -   **AI pair programming tools**
    -   **AI-powered analytics interfaces**

Employees can now upload bills directly and Airwallex will automatically extract all relevant details using AI and OCR technology, so no manual data entry is needed. With your chart of account data imported from your accounting software, bills can be easily coded by employees as well. Later, when the bill is ready for payment, Airwallex uses AI to check for duplicate invoices and to check that the payment details match the invoice to ensure money is being sent to the right recipient.
