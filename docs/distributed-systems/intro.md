In this series of articles, I will try my best to writing notes of the distributed system, I hope you will also learn from it.

I am not seriouly doing researching, so there might be mistakes, feel free to discuss with me here [issue](https://github.com/ColaLinN/fenglyu-docs-site-v1/issues).

I will like to go through each critical definition one by one, so there will be. 

##  Why Distributed Systems?

Dsitributed System has been used broadly in real life. For example, Google, Amazon, Tiktok, etc. 

**The Challenges/Ability of Distributed System**

1. Failure Tolerance
2. Managing Distributed State
3. Scalability
4. Architecture and Design

So now, do you still thinking

## Thought Experiement: Two General's Problem

From this thought experiement, we know that It is impossible to reach a final agreement with unstable communication channel.

But, we can solve it in engineering ways by bypassing some assumptions and allow trade-offs. 

There are lots of solutions published, such as the following:

1. TODO

> For example, the Consensus Algorithmn
