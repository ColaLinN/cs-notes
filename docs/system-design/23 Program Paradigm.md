**Object Oriented Programming，OOP 面向对象编程**

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is **a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic**. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.



Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)),[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBloch2018xi–xiiForeword-4) [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), etc.) are [multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language) and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).
