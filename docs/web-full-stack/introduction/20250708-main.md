-   I also began turning some of my ideas into small products(Dream of starting my own company)
    -   In 2024 July, I developed and luanched a website, **[https://sgpass.info](https://sgpass.info)**, to collect and scrape data related to Singapore PR applications.
        -   More recently, I developed a **browser plugin** that can **track and fetch real-time PR application status**.
    -   Earlier 2025, I launched an AI Agents at Shopee for Dev Efficiency.
-   Meanwhile, I’ve also been **documenting and sharing** what I learn:
