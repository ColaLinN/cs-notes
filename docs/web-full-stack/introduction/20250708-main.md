Over the past two years, I began to feel unmotivated by routine business requirements, so I started actively seeking new opportunities to explore different areas and push beyond my comfort zone

>   -   In Jan 2024, I began pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at **NUS**, focusing on **AI-related courses**.

In summary, I am **passionate** about building impactful products that benefit users and solve real problems.

However, the direction I’m currently exploring doesn’t fully align with my day-to-day work. That’s why I’m now looking for opportunities to work with people who share similar interests—or who are even more experienced—so I can grow alongside them.
