4. substrig means the contiguous sequence of elements within an array

5. "O(n)" is pronounced as "oh of en" or "big oh of en." It's a way of describing the time complexity of an algorithm, indicating that the algorithm's performance grows linearly with the size of the input (n).

6. 单调递增的线段 monotonically increasing line segment
   1. Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order
   1. There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).
